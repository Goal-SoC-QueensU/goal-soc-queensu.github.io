4:T8a2,Dr. Salimur Choudhury, a computer scientist at Queen’s University and founder of the GOAL (Global Optimization, Analytics, and Learning) Lab, is addressing the rising crisis of rural emergency room closures across Ontario through data-driven tools and AI-powered decision-making systems.

In 2023 alone, over 600 ER closures were recorded in rural Ontario. Dr. Choudhury’s lab is tackling this issue by analyzing ER visit data and using predictive models to help healthcare leaders allocate scarce resources such as physicians and supplies. A major focus is Northern Ontario, where limited staffing and vast distances often leave communities vulnerable.

His team is also investigating the effects of climate change on seasonal winter roads that connect remote areas. Using satellite imagery and geospatial data, they aim to forecast disruptions and proactively guide regional coordination, staffing decisions, and emergency planning.

Beyond ER access, the GOAL Lab has developed AI-based tools to reduce the administrative burden in family medicine, including an autofill system for referral forms that improves efficiency and saves physicians valuable time. Choudhury's broader research vision, called 'decision intelligence,' pushes AI to not only analyze data but autonomously generate and act on solutions. One such tool converts natural language descriptions of real-world problems into mathematical optimization models and solver-ready code.

To ensure impact, Dr. Choudhury strategically publishes across both technical and healthcare-focused platforms, ensuring policymakers can engage with his findings. He also collaborates with hospitals, startups, and governments, and mentors new researchers dedicated to data-informed health equity.

“In a strained healthcare system,” he says, “small algorithmic approaches can make a meaningful difference.”

Dr. Choudhury’s work lays the foundation for a smarter, more accessible, and equitable healthcare future—one that supports every Canadian, regardless of geography.

This accolade marks her second Governor General’s Gold Medal in Canada, having previously received one for her Master’s degree, and her third academic gold medal overall—an extraordinary achievement underscoring her academic excellence and dedication.

Adding to the significance of the moment, her PhD supervisor, Dr. Kai Salomaa, was simultaneously honored with the Excellence in Graduate Supervision Award, making the convocation ceremony an especially memorable milestone for both mentor and student. Dr. Emu also expressed deep gratitude to her supervisors, Dr. Salimur Choudhury and Dr. Kai Salomaa, and acknowledged the continued support from her academic community throughout her journey.

Dr. Emu has now embarked on a new chapter of her career as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). She is actively seeking to recruit graduate students (PhD and Master’s level), both domestic and international, to work on cutting-edge research in the areas of Quantum Computing and Optimization.6:T402,Dr. Naveed Ejaz, an esteemed postdoctoral researcher in the GOAL Lab and AI Researcher specializing in Deep Learning, has been awarded the prestigious 2025 Research Award by the School of Computing at Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada. This recognition highlights his outstanding contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence and his dedication to advancing impactful research.

Dr. Ejaz expressed heartfelt gratitude to his supervisor, Dr. Salimur Choudhury, and his colleagues for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout his research journey. He emphasized that this award is a shared achievement, reflecting the collaborative spirit of the GOAL Lab. The recognition serves as a powerful motivator for Dr. Ejaz to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in AI and Deep Learning.

As an experienced educator and industry-academia collaborator, Dr. Ejaz remains committed to fostering cutting-edge research and mentoring the next generation of scholars in the field of Artificial Intelligence.0:["aJfvUy2O1_kypC3c_0E-H",[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-0","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{"news":[{"title":"Dr. Salimur Choudhury Leads AI Revolution in Healthcare Resource Planning Across Rural Canada","date":"2025-07-14","excerpt":"Dr. Salimur Choudhury is using AI and decision intelligence to help prevent ER closures, optimize healthcare resources, and build a more resilient and equitable system for rural and northern communities.","description":"$4","featured":true,"thumbnail":"n003.png"},{"title":"Dr. Mahzabeen Emu Receives Governor General’s Academic Gold Medal","date":"2025-07-04","excerpt":"Dr. Mahzabeen Emu, a recent PhD graduate from Queen’s University and alumna of the GOAL Lab, has been awarded the prestigious Governor General’s Academic Gold Medal.
