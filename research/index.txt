4:T85f,Internet of Everything (IoE) refers to the intelligent connection among people, things, data, and processes, essentially inclining toward the next-generation networks. To unleash the full potential of the IoE framework, it often requires nearly real-time management decisions regarding deployment and scheduling operations. The IoE service management problems, primarily formulated as traditional mathematical programming models, are NP-hard, hence inappropriate for time-sensitive IoE environments. This research project promotes the need to go beyond the realms and leverage quantum computing-based service management. We also intend to evaluate the feasibility of applying quantum computing for such IoE optimization based on today’s available quantum resources (qubits). Further along this line, we envision determining the advantages of solving NP-hard problems using quantum computing over classical approaches and major trade-offs hindering the applicability. In this regard, three IoE domains have been chosen: Network Function Virtualization, Metaverse, and Autonomous/Electric Vehicles. Based on the research progress so far, hybrid quantum-classical computing is the key to solve futuristic IoE service management optimizations, considering the limited availability of quantum computing resources (qubits). The synergistic research for quantum computing-enabled network optimization and analytics can be regarded as an effort to scale down massive resource fabrication costs and upgrade profit margins for service providers. Designing quantum-compliant optimization modeling and quantum AI models are the two most important technical aspects of this research. Moreover, we strive to increase the scalability of quantum computing by using hybrid classical-quantum approaches, considering the availability of limited/restricted quantum resources (qubits) in today’s world. The research outcomes are expected to portray a clear picture of where we stand in terms of available quantum resources, along with their feasibility and scalability. Hence, we continuously endeavor to learn the prospects of quantum computing in the future.5:T80e,Significant progress has been made in machine learning (ML) systems for predictive tasks. However, their utility diminishes considerably when essential conditions are not met, rendering ML not only ineffective but potentially dangerous. One challenge is the presence of unexplained bias within ML predictions. This unexplained bias, often stemming from the complex relationships between variables, can reduce the reliability of predictions, casting doubt on the fairness and equity of the ML system. 

Furthermore, the inherent brittleness of ML predictions further exacerbates the problem. ML models require that the training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution, which hinders their capacity for out-of-distribution generalization. This inherent lack of robustness restricts the suitability of conventional ML systems for the critical task of aiding in personalized decision support. To confront these inherent limitations, this project will leverage causal machine learning, which bridges the disciplines of causal inference and ML. Causal inference equips us with the tools to quantify the impact of interventions, thereby providing actionable insights conducive to personalized decision-making. On the other hand, ML excels in harnessing multi-modal, unstructured, and high-dimensional data, which are increasingly prevalent in today’s data landscape. This fusion of methodologies not only overcomes existing limitations but also paves the way for a more comprehensive and effective approach to data-driven decision support. 

This project will include applications across various domains, including healthcare, business and marketing, and engineering, all with the goal of enhancing personalized decision-making. A particular focus will be on modeling temporal causal relationships, which have not been widely explored. The overarching goal is to create AI systems that are not only powerful but also accountable and ethical, ultimately benefiting humanity by providing transparent, understanding, and insightful decision-making support.0:["1VOw86AVgabGfqX9wAAkA",[[["",{"children":["research",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["research",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto px-4 py-16","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center mb-12","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl font-bold mb-4","children":"Research Projects"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":"Explore our cutting-edge research in optimization, analytics, and machine learning across various domains including healthcare, autonomous systems, and quantum computing."}]]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"projects":[{"title":"Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing for Next-Generation Internet Resource Allocation","image":"r001.png","shortDesc":"Internet of Everything (IoE) refers to the intelligent connection among people, things, data, and processes, essentially inclining toward the next-generation networks.","fullDesc":"$4","tags":[],"featured":false,"relatedPubs":[]},{"title":"Matching Algorithms for Operations Based on UN Sustainability Goals","image":"","shortDesc":"The United Nations designed the sustainable development goals with the target to integrate the economic, social and environmental developments between the developed and developing countries within 2030.","fullDesc":"The United Nations designed the sustainable development goals with the target to integrate the economic, social and environmental developments between the developed and developing countries within 2030.
